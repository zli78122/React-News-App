## Introduction
* Used a combination of **ES6**, **React-Bootstrap**, **React.js**, **pubsub.js** on client side and **Node.js**, **Express.js** on server side to develop a news application based on **Responsive Web Design**, which can adapt to PC and mobile devices. The application is deployed to **Google Cloud**.
* Created multiple **code-reusable** components, like comment, notification, news card, and built scalable server-side **RESTful** APIs.
* Implemented real-time update of news data fetched from Guardian News API and New York Times API using **Axios**.
* Developed **auto-completion** when searching by keyword using **Azure Bing Autosuggest API** and throttled function calling to lower server load.
* Utilized HTML5 **localStorage** as web cache to support adding articles to and removing articles from bookmark.
